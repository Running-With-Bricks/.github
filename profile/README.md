# Running With Bricks

We makes games and software for [Brick Hill](https://brick-hill.com)

Most of our stuff is currently private, but will be made open source when it gets to a usable stage!

 
  
### What we currently have in the works:
- Brick Stacker: A Brick Hill workshop written in C++ and OpenGL
- Caramel Client: A Brick Hill client made in godot
- CSHill: A Brick Hill server written in C# and .NET (Name will probably change)
- A mmorpg game for Brick Hill
- We also have alot of other game ideas that might become something someday

<sub>We are a bit lazy so these might take quite a while to come out :trollface:</sub>
