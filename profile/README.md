<h3 align="center">Running With Bricks</h3>

### Description
We make games and software.

Most of our stuff is currently private, but will be made open source when it gets to a usable stage!

### What we currently have in the works:
- SandPile: A social platform to make games using Brick Hill's legacy client and to socialize with people ([Website](https://sandpile.xyz))
- Brick Stacker: A Brick Hill workshop written in C++ and OpenGL ([Source](https://github.com/Running-With-Bricks/Brick-Stacker-OpenGL))
- CSHill: A Brick Hill server written in C# and .NET (Name will probably change)
- BrickScape: A MMORPG game for Brick Hill
- We also have alot of other game ideas that might become something someday

<sub>We are a bit lazy so these might take quite a while to come out :trollface:</sub>

yek is cunt
