<h3 align="center">Running With Bricks</h3>

### Description
We makes games and software.

Most of our stuff is currently private, but will be made open source when it gets to a usable stage!

### What we currently have in the works:
- Brick Stacker: A Brick Hill workshop written in C++ and OpenGL
- Caramel Client: An open source Brick Hill client made in Godot
- CSHill: A Brick Hill server written in C# and .NET (Name will probably change)
- A mmorpg game for Brick Hill
- We also have alot of other game ideas that might become something someday

<sub>We are a bit lazy so these might take quite a while to come out :trollface:</sub>
